# GTM Custom User ID Cookie (CUIC)

Consent-based, long-lived first-party ID cookie for privacy-friendly user tracking in restrictive environments.

## Overview

**Custom User ID Cookie** enables the generation and secure persistence of a random user ID across sessions using an HTTP-only, first-party cookie. The ID is generated client-side in GTM (based on user consent, if applied) and made available immediately ‚Äì even before the cookie is set ‚Äì for GA4 tracking and other downstream integrations.

CUIC is fully compatible with ITP/ETP restrictions and enables stable cross-session identification in Safari and Firefox. It supports the use of user_id in both client- and server-side tracking architectures.

All key behaviors ‚Äî such as cookie name, expiration, refresh policy, and visibility ‚Äî are controlled centrally via GTM. No PHP code changes are needed to switch between test and production setups.


## Key Features

* Persistent first-party, secure, HTTP-only cookie (SameSite=Lax)
* ID available on first pageview ‚Äì usable before the cookie is stored
* Fully consent-controllable via GTM
* Compatible with Safari/Firefox ITP/ETP restrictions
* HTTP-only cookie value accessible via GTM data layer 
* Entire behavior (refresh, name, expiration) controlled via GTM
* Optional fallback via <img> if XHR is blocked
* Ideal for GA4 user_id and server-side tracking setups

## What Problem Does CUIC Solve?

| üîç Problem                                                                                                            | ‚úÖ CUIC Solution                                                                                                                               |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st-party, long-lived cookie required, but: <br>only valid if set server-side with secure, same-origin conditions | CUIC sets the cookie server-side on the main domain using PHP ‚Äî not via JavaScript                                                        |
| Consent is required before setting any ID, including via server                                                   | CUIC integrates seamlessly with GTM consent triggers, ensuring privacy compliance                                                         |
| GA4 and server must use the same ID immediately, even before the cookie exists                                    | CUIC uses a central variable (`jsUserIdResolve`) to generate or reuse the ID and send it simultaneously to GA4 and the cookie handler |
| On subsequent pageviews, the HttpOnly cookie is not accessible via JS, and the ID must still be available in GTM  | CUIC exposes the cookie value via a PHP dataLayer snippet (`cuic_datalayer-snippet.php`), making the ID available before GTM loads    |
| Multiple entry points / pageviews must not generate multiple IDs                                                  | CUIC ensures consistent logic in both GTM and PHP: existing values are always reused if present (in dataLayer or cookies)                 |
| Safari and Firefox block or shorten JS-set cookies                                                                | CUIC fully complies with Safari/Firefox ITP: 1st party, secure, SameSite=Lax, server-set, HttpOnly                                            |
| XHR requests may fail due to ad blockers or ITP                                                                   | CUIC includes an automatic fallback using an image GET request if the main XHR fails                                                      |

## Architecture & Data Flow

The diagram below illustrates the CUIC cookie lifecycle across first and subsequent pageviews:

![CUIC Architecture & Data Flow](assets/cuic-architecture-and-data-flow.png)

## Components

* **`cuic_cookie-handler.php`**<br>Server-side handler that sets the cookie via POST or GET ‚Äì supports dynamic config via GTM
* **`cuic_datalayer-snippet.php`**<br>PHP snippet which exposes the cookie value to the `dataLayer` via PHP ‚Äì required when using `HttpOnly` cookies
* **`cuic_controller.html`**<br>GTM Custom HTML tag that sends the ID to the server ‚Äì includes XHR logic with fallback image request 
* **`jsUserIdResolve.js`**<br>Central GTM variable that checks for an existing value in the dataLayer (from cookie snippet or previous tag push) or creates a new ID on first pageview ‚Äì ensures consistent value at all times

## Installation Guide

1. **Deploy the server scripts** to your main domain (same origin as your GTM container):
   - `/cuic_cookie-handler.php`
   - `/cuic_datalayer-snippet.php` (include in `<head>` before GTM)

2. **Create GTM variables**:
   - Add `jsUserIdResolve.js` as a **Custom JavaScript Variable**
   - Name it `jsUserIdResolved` or similar

3. **Add the GTM tag**:
   - Use `cuic_controller.html` as a **Custom HTML Tag**
   - Adjust path to `/cuic_cookie-handler.php` if needed
   - Reference the `jsUserIdResolved` variable in the tag
   - Trigger only **after valid consent**

4. **Make the ID available to GA4**:
   - Use `{{jsUserIdResolved}}` as `user_id` in your GA4 Config and Events

5. **Customize behavior via GTM**:
   - All cookie parameters (`name`, `refresh`, `maxAge`, `httpOnly`) are configurable via inline variables in the tag
   - No PHP edits required

## Consent & Privacy

* CUIC should only run after user consent (fully controlled via GTM)
* No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored
* No fingerprinting, no localStorage
* Fully compliant with ITP, ETP, GDPR, and ePrivacy standards

## Use Case: Testing Multiple Cookie Variants

CUIC makes it easy to test different cookie configurations (e.g. name, expiration, visibility, refresh behavior) **without modifying any server-side code**. Just duplicate the GTM tag (`cuic_controller.html`) and adjust the inline config:

- `cn`: cookie name (e.g. `tkncstm_test`)
- `refresh`: `1` = extend on every visit, `0` = set once
- `httpOnly`: `1` = HTTP-only (default), `0` = JS-readable
- `maxAge`: cookie lifetime in seconds (e.g. `3600` for 1 hour)

You can run **multiple variants in parallel** using different GTM tags and triggers ‚Äî all handled by the same `cuic_cookie-handler.php` on the server.
